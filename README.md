# Madam Eva

## A simple python script to simulate a Tarokka reading from Madam Eva for Curse of Strahd

This was created because my own Curse of Strahd campaign was played online, making a physical reading impossible. This will output five random cards from the appropriate decks to simulate a full reading.
